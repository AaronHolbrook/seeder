Seeder
======

**Purpose**
Perform heavy and/or infrequent actions in a controlled manner.

**Usage**
Use the `\AaronHolbrook\doing_seed` action hook to perform logic that you want to manually activate.

This could be anything such as pre-filling content, auto-creating terms, updating the database in a certain manner, talking to or updating an API, etc.

**Credit**
Special thanks to [@joshlevinson](https://github.com/joshlevinson) for pioneering the first version of this plugin and for coining the term of `seeding`.
